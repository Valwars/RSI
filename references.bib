	abstract = {In tourism industry, reservation or booking through the Internet is now so common; it is becoming the practice among the big or small industry players. However, what is missing and lacking is the concept of virtual imaging that represent the ongoing transaction. For this paper, the focus is visualizing real time reservation for an island-based vacation area. Up to now, most of the information is conveyed to the customers through plain boring old text or through verbal explanation given by service provider through phone or emailing system. Major frustration is caused by not knowing the exact location of the reserved facility within the particular area. So, this paper discusses in detail the weakness of current reservation process that can be avoided by applying an improved multimedia management technology through graphics visualization technique},

These operations include extracting subparts of a space-time cube, flattening it across space or time, or transforming the cube's geometry or content. We introduce a taxonomy of elementary space-time cube operations, and explain how they can be combined to turn a three-dimensional space-time cube into an easily-readable two-dimensional visualization. Our model captures most visualizations showing two or more data dimensions in addition to time, such as geotemporal visualizations, dynamic networks, time-evolving scatterplots, or videos. We finally review interactive systems that support a range of operations. By introducing this conceptual framework we hope to facilitate the description, criticism and comparison of existing temporal data visualizations, as well as encourage the exploration of new techniques and systems.},

They need easy-to-use systems that are able to support them in the task of accessing and manipulating the data contained in the databases.

He designed his datasets so that statistical methods such as mean, standard deviations, and correlation coefficients produced the same values, but when viewed as four scattergrams, the dataset patterns were immediately recognizable. Temporal categorical datasets provide new challenges for designers of visual presentations and statistical algorithms. Existing spreadsheet, database, and statistical tools are poorly matched with the needs of temporal data. Visual presentations of even a single timeline help clean up troubling data errors and reveal meaningful patterns in the data. More complex patterns can be found when multiple timelines can be seen simultaneously. Adding many event types generates still richer patterns. This paper shows examples of the power of visual presentations to enable users to make important insights.},

We also discuss how well researchers had evaluated the usability and intuitiveness of interaction techniques. We aimed to reﬂect on the strengths and weaknesses of the evaluations. To that end, from the perspective of human cognition, we reviewed the goals, procedures, and ﬁndings of evaluations. Principally, human cognition is engaged when they perform tasks in a tool. The interaction techniques bridge the gap between human cognition and the goals they want to achieve from the tool. To sum up, in this review, we present a novel triad ‘goals-interaction techniques-cognition’ taxonomy. Besides, the review suggests the need for further work to enhance tools and understand users.},

Here, we contribute a systematic review of 30 years of work in this adjacent ﬁeld, and highlight techniques and principles we believe to be underappreciated in visualization work. We structure our review along two axes. First, we use task taxonomies from the visualization literature to structure the space of interactions in usual systems. Second, we created a categorization of data management work that strikes a balance between speciﬁcity and generality. Concretely, we contribute a characterization of 131 research papers along these two axes. We ﬁnd that ﬁve notions in data management venues ﬁt interactive visualization systems well: materialized views, approximate query processing, user modeling and query prediction, multi-query optimization, lineage techniques, and indexing techniques. In addition, we ﬁnd a preponderance of work in materialized views and approximate query processing, most targeting a limited subset of the interaction tasks in the taxonomy we used. This suggests natural avenues of future research both in visualization and data management. Our categorization both changes how we visualization researchers design and build our systems, and highlights where future work is necessary.},

Time granularity is flexible on granularity levels, and a grouping configuration of one level is used to display the calendar visual representation of that same granularity level. Furthermore, user interaction breadcrumbs are applied in order to provide better linear analysis of temporal characteristics of data without losing data overview. It is also possible to compare multiple different views of various time subsets.},

On one hand producing a visual artefact has a number of advantages: it helps designers to externalise their thought and acts as a common language between different stakeholders. On the other hand, if an inappropriate visualisation method is employed it could hinder the design process. To support the design of HCI systems, this paper reviews the categorisation of visualisation methods used in HCI. A keyword search is conducted to identify a) current HCI design methods, b) approaches of selecting these methods. The resulting design methods are filtered to create a list of just visualisation methods. These are then categorised using the approaches identified in (b). As a result 23 HCI visualisation methods are identified and categorised in 5 selection approaches (The Recipient, Primary Purpose, Visual Archetype, Interaction Type, and The Design Process).},

	abstract = {Even though interaction is an important part of information visualization (Infovis), it has garnered a relatively low level of attention from the Infovis community. A few frameworks and taxonomies of Infovis interaction techniques exist, but they typically focus on low-level operations and do not address the variety of benefits interaction provides. After conducting an extensive review of Infovis systems and their interactive capabilities, we propose seven general categories of interaction techniques widely used in Infovis: 1) Select, 2) Explore, 3) Reconfigure, 4) Encode, 5) Abstract/Elaborate, 6) Filter, and 7) Connect. These categories are organized around a user’s intent while interacting with a system rather than the low-level interaction techniques provided by a system. The categories can act as a framework to help discuss and evaluate interaction techniques and hopefully lay an initial foundation toward a deeper understanding and a science of interaction.},

	abstract = {Over the past few years the web has been responsible for the rise in popularity of visualizations and it seems that interactive or playable visualizations have become more popular and end up standing out more. The use of interactivity and animation has been extensively discussed in information visualization research, but there has been some controversy in relation to its benefits. Additionally, there is still little empirical evidence about its efficacy in terms of improving understanding of the data and there is few research that points out guidelines of how to incorporate it successfully and that proves that playable visualizations are indeed more enjoyable and popular among users. In order to guide future research on the actual benefits of interactivity in visualization it is important to understand what types of interactivity are currently being used in the field and to have a framework to help discuss and evaluate interaction techniques. After conducting an extensive review of popular visualizations and their interactive capabilities, we propose eleven categories of interaction techniques: filtering, selecting, abstract/elaborate, overview and explore, connect/relate, history, extraction of features, reconfigure, encode, participation/collaboration, and gamification.},

	abstract = {Learning analytics systems often use interactive visualisations to display information. Interactivity is typically used by visualisation designers to reduce cognitive load for users. However, our research suggests that interactivity holds significant value beyond the reduction of cognitive load. Informed by theories about meaning, perception and experience, we propose that interactive visualisations promote emergent meaning-making processes which should be accounted for in the design of interactive learning analytics visualisations. We present findings from a qualitative study of four teachers engaging with interactive visualisations in an Australian university. The study used a think-a-loud protocol and a semi-structured interview which were coded according to theory-informed constructs of dimensions of meaning and interaction opportunities. Our findings suggest that interactive visualisations that had been designed with regard to meaning-making stimulated users to engage more deeply with the data and explore it at different resolutions, from overview to detail. The interactive visualisations afforded more opportunities for users to gain understanding and insights they found meaningful. While this is a small study, we argue that it opens up promising avenues for further investigation; provides a practical approach to gather further useful data about interactivity and meaning-making; and suggests new principles that may be helpful for designers of interactive learning analytics visualisations.},

In Trendalyzer, animation together with interesting data and an engaging presenter helps the audience understand the results of an analysis of the data. It is less clear whether trend animation is effective for analysis. This paper proposes two alternative trend visualizations that use static depictions of trends: one which shows traces of all trends overlaid simultaneously in one display and a second that uses a small multiples display to show the trend traces side-by-side. The paper evaluates the three visualizations for both analysis and presentation. Results indicate that trend animation can be challenging to use even for presentations; while it is the fastest technique for presentation and participants find it enjoyable and exciting, it does lead to many participant errors. Animation is the least effective form for analysis; both static depictions of trends are significantly faster than animation, and the small multiples display is more accurate.},

	abstract = {During the last decade Visual Exploration and Visual Data Mining techniques have proven to be of high value in exploratory data analysis since they combine human visual perception and recognition capabilities with the enormous storage capacity and the computational power of today's computer systems in order to detect patterns and trends in the data. But the ever increasing mass of information leads to new challenges on visualization techniques and concepts. Due to technological progress in computer power and storage capacity today's scientific and commercial applications are capable of generating, storing and processing massive amounts of data. Most existing visualization metaphors and concepts do not scale well on such large data sets as interaction capabilities and visual representations suffer from the massive number of data points. To bridge this gap, Visual Analytics aim to incorporate more intelligent means than to just retrieve and display the data items to filter the relevant from the non-relevant data. In this context the paper introduces a new approach based on a Multiresolution paradigm to increase the scalability of existing Visual data exploration techniques. The basic idea is to provide relevance driven compact representations of the underlying data set that present the data at different granularities. In the visualization step the available display space is then distributed according to the data granularity, to emphasize relevant information. The paper aims at introducing a technical base of Multiresolution visualization and provides an application example that shows the usefulness of the proposed approach.},

The Circle View technique is a combination of hierarchical visualization techniques, such as treemaps [6], and circular layout techniques such as Pie Charts and Circle Segments [2]. The main goal is to compare continuous data changing their characteristics over time in order to identify patterns, exceptions and similarities in the data.To achieve this goal Circle View is a intuitive and easy to understand visualization interface to enable the user very fast to acquire the information needed. This is an important feature for fast changing visualization caused by time related data streams. Circle View supports the visualization of the changing characteristics over time, to allow the user the observation of changes in the data. Additionally it provides user interaction and drill down mechanism depending on user demands for a effective exploratory data analysis. There is also the capability of exploring correlations and exceptions in the data by using similarity and ordering algorithms.},

	abstract = {Calendar applications for small handheld devices are growing in popularity. This led us to develop DateLens, a novel calendar interface for PDAs designed to support complex tasks. It uses a fisheye representation coupled with compact overviews to give the big picture in a small space. The interface also gives users control over the visible time period, as well as supporting integrated search to discover patterns and outliers. Designed with device scalability in mind, DateLens currently runs on desktop computers as well as PDAs. Two user studies were conducted to examine the viability of DateLens as a replacement for traditional calendar visualizations. In the first study, non-PDA users performed complex tasks significantly faster with DateLens than with the Microsoft Pocket PC 2002TM calendar (using a PDA emulator). In addition, they rated DateLens as being easier to use than the default calendar application for a majority of the tasks. In the second study, the participants were expert Pocket PC users and the software was run on their own devices. Again, DateLens performed significantly faster for the complex tasks, and there were satisfaction differences favoring each calendar for different kinds of tasks. From these studies, it is clear that DateLens is superior for more complex tasks such as those associated with longer time periods. For daily event tracking, users familiar with the default Pocket PC calendar strongly preferred its daily view and behaviors.},

Twenty combinations of these choices are viable timeline designs that can be matched to different narrative points, while smooth animated transitions between narrative points allow for the presentation of a cohesive story, an important aspect of both interactive storytelling and data videos. We further validate this design space by realizing the full set of viable timeline designs and transitions in a proof-of-concept sandbox implementation that we used to produce seven example timeline stories.

In this work, we investigate a Space-Time Cube in the Immersive Analytics domain. Based on a review of previous work and selecting an appropriate exploration metaphor, we built a prototype environment where the cube is coupled to a virtual representation of the analyst's real desk, and zooming and panning in space and time are intuitively controlled using mid-air gestures. We compared our immersive environment to a desktop-based implementation in a user study with 20 participants across 7 tasks of varying difficulty, which targeted different user interface features. To investigate how performance is affected in the presence of clutter, we explored two scenarios with different numbers of trajectories. While the quantitative performance was similar for the majority of tasks, large differences appear when we analyze the patterns of interaction and consider subjective metrics. The immersive version of the Space-Time Cube received higher usability scores, much higher user preference, and was rated to have a lower mental workload, without causing participants discomfort in 25-minute-long VR sessions.},

	title = {The {Space}-{Time} {Cube} {Revisited} from a {Geovisualization} {Perspective}},
	abstract = {At the end of the sixties H‰gerstrand introduced a space-time model which included features such as a Space-TimePath, and a Space-Time-Prism. His model is often seen as the start of the time-geography studies. Throughout the years his model has been applied and improved to understand our movements through space. Problems studied can be found in different fields of geography, and range from those on an individual movement to whole theories to optimize transportation. From a visualization perspective the Space-Time-Cube was the most prominent element in Hagerstrandís approach. In its basic appearance these images consist of a cube with on its base a representation of geography (along the x- and y-axis), while the cubeís height represents time (z-axis). A typical Space-Time-Cube could contain the space time-paths of for instance individuals or bus routes. However, when the concept was introduced the options to create the graphics were limited to manual methods and the user could only experience the single view created by the draftsperson. An alternative view on the cube would mean to go through a laborious drawing exercise. Todayís software has options to automatically create the cube and its contents from a database. Data acquisition of space-time paths for both individuals and groups is also made easier using GPS. Today, the userís viewing environment is, by default, interactive and allows one to view the cube from any direction. In this paper an extended interactive and dynamic visualization environment is proposed, and demonstrated, in which the user has full flexibility to view, manipulate and query the data in a Space-Time-Cube. Included are options to move slider planes along each of the axes to for instance select, or highlight a period in time or location in space. Examples will be discussed in which the time axis is manipulated by for instance changing world time for event time (time cartograms). Creativity should not stop here since it has been shown that especially an alternative perspective on the data will sparkle the mind with new ideas. The user should be allowed to for instance let the x- and/or y-axis be represented by other variables of the theme studied. Since the cube is seen as an integral part of a geovisualization environment the option to link other views with other graphic representation does exist.},
